    <h2 class="text-align-center">Rep. Espaillat Appropriations Wins</h2><p>Every year, as a member of the House Committee on Appropriations, Congressman Espaillat attends hearings on 12 appropriations bills, each setting the yearly budget for a part of the government. And in every hearing, Rep. Espaillat fights to secure funding for our local community and important programs that have been underfunded. <br><br>This interactive tool developed by our office allows constituents to explore the funding I have helped secure for my most important legislative priorities. </p><p><style type="text/css"></style>
